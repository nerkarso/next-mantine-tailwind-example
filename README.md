# next-mantine-tailwind-example

This example is a demonstration of how to integrate Mantine and Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project without conflicts.

> [!TIP]
> The trick to make this work is give [Tailwind base lower priority with the @layer rule](https://github.com/PauliCZ44/MantineTW/blob/main/src/index.css).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using Next.js Pages Router and Mantine v6, then switch to branch v1.

## Dependencies

- Next.js `v14.1`
- Mantine `v7.4`
- Tailwind CSS `v3.4`

## Setup

```

Make sure you choose the following options:

✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … Yes
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/*
```

2. Install Mantine dependencies:

```sh
pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks
```

3. Copy and paste the following files and folders into your project:

```sh

```

4. You're all set!
